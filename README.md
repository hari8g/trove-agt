## Getting Started
This section guides you through **cleaning the repository**, setting up the **right virtual environment**, and **ensuring dependencies** are installed.

### Step 1: **Clean the Repository (Optional, but Recommended)**
If you've cloned the repository before and want to reset:
```sh
rm -rf trove-agt
```
Then, re-clone it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hari8g/trove-agt.git
cd trove-agt
```

### Step 2: **Ensure You Are in the Right Virtual Environment**
Create a virtual environment (if not already created):
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

To verify the environment is activated:
```sh
type python  # Should return path to the virtual env
```

### Step 3: **Install Dependencies**
Ensure all dependencies are installed as per `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: **Verify Installation**
Run the following to check if everything is installed correctly:
```sh
python -m pip list
```
Make sure all necessary libraries (like `openai`, `matplotlib`, `fpdf`, `dotenv`) are installed.

## Trove Architecture
### **Understanding `trove_agent.py` (Core of the Framework)**
The `trove_agent.py` file inside `agents_trove/` defines the **TroveAgent class**, which is the **foundation of the multi-agent system**. It acts as the base class from which specialized agents (like the Energy Assistant) inherit core functionalities.

### **Core Components of TroveAgent**
1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**
   - Sets up the agent with key attributes such as:
     - `agent_name`: Unique identifier for the agent.
     - `system_prompt`: Defines the role and functionality of the agent.
     - `llm`: Defines the AI model the agent will use.
     - `autosave`: Determines if the agent should save states automatically.
     - `verbose`: Enables detailed logging for debugging.
   
2. **Memory Management**
   - Implements both **short-term** and **long-term memory**.
   - Memory storage allows agents to retain and retrieve past information for decision-making.
   
3. **Tool Integration**
   - Agents can register and utilize tools dynamically.
   - Example: The `calculate_efficiency` function in `tools_trove/efficiency_tool.py` is added to the agent as a tool.
   
4. **Task Execution (`run` method)**
   - Processes user inputs, interacts with tools, and generates AI-driven responses.
   - Enables multi-turn interactions between agents.
   
5. **State Management & Persistence**
   - Saves agent states in **JSON, YAML, and TOML formats**.
   - Can reload past states to maintain context across sessions.
   
6. **Dynamic Learning & Adaptation**
   - Can **ingest documents** and **learn from external sources**.
   - Enables advanced analysis, such as **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

### **Example Workflow of TroveAgent**
- When an agent (e.g., Energy Assistant) is instantiated:
  1. It loads **configuration** and **memory states**.
  2. It **retrieves energy data** from `data_trove/energy_data.json`.
  3. It processes user requests through **LLM-based analysis**.
  4. It executes relevant **tools**, such as efficiency calculation.
  5. It **generates reports** and saves outputs for further use.

## Example: Running the Energy Assistant
The **Energy Assistant** is an agent that analyzes energy consumption and generates efficiency reports.

### **Step 1: Setup API Keys**
Ensure your `.env` file inside the `env/` folder has your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### **Step 2: Run the Energy Assistant**
Execute the script inside the `scripts_trove/` folder:
```sh
cd scripts_trove
python energy_assistant.py
```

### **Step 3: Expected Output**
- The script loads **energy data** from `data_trove/energy_data.json`
- It performs an **energy consumption analysis**
- It calculates **efficiency** using the efficiency tool
- Generates a **PDF report** with:
  - **Insights from AI** üìä
  - **Tabular Representation** üìù
  - **Graphs and Charts** üìà

### **Step 4: Locate the Report**
The PDF report is saved in the same folder as `energy_assistant.py`:
```
energy_report.pdf
```
