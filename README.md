# Open-Source Multi-Agent Framework - Trove

## Overview
The **Trove Multi-Agent Framework** is a fully open-source, modular, and extensible AI framework designed for multi-agent collaboration. This framework enables seamless interaction between intelligent agents, equipping them with the ability to leverage tools, process real-world data, and automate complex decision-making across diverse domains such as **mobility, logistics, healthcare, finance, energy, research, cybersecurity, and industrial automation**.

Trove is envisioned as a **catalyst for accelerating AI innovation**, providing an open foundation for developing state-of-the-art autonomous agents that can assist in eliminating repetitive tasks, optimizing workflows, and augmenting human intelligence. By making **AI-driven automation more accessible**, Trove empowers researchers, developers, and enterprises to build intelligent agents that can **autonomously perform complex operations**, reducing cognitive load and driving efficiency.

## Why Trove?
In an era where AI adoption is increasing across industries, having an **open-source** and **community-driven** framework allows rapid experimentation, knowledge sharing, and the creation of highly specialized AI agents. Trove aims to:

To verify the environment is activated:
```sh
type python  # Should return path to the virtual env
```

### Step 3: **Install Dependencies**
Ensure all dependencies are installed as per `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Trove Architecture
### **Understanding `trove_agent.py` (Core of the Framework)**
The `trove_agent.py` file inside `agents_trove/` defines the **TroveAgent class**, which is the **foundation of the multi-agent system**. It acts as the base class from which specialized agents (like the Energy Assistant) inherit core functionalities.

### **Core Components of TroveAgent**
1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**
   - Sets up the agent with key attributes such as:
     - `agent_name`: Unique identifier for the agent.
     - `system_prompt`: Defines the role and functionality of the agent.
     - `llm`: Defines the AI model the agent will use.
     - `autosave`: Determines if the agent should save states automatically.
     - `verbose`: Enables detailed logging for debugging.
   
2. **Memory Management**
   - Implements both **short-term** and **long-term memory**.
   - Memory storage allows agents to retain and retrieve past information for decision-making.
   
3. **Tool Integration**
   - Agents can register and utilize tools dynamically.
   - Example: The `calculate_efficiency` function in `tools_trove/efficiency_tool.py` is added to the agent as a tool.
   
4. **Task Execution (`run` method)**
   - Processes user inputs, interacts with tools, and generates AI-driven responses.
   - Enables multi-turn interactions between agents.
   
5. **State Management & Persistence**
   - Saves agent states in **JSON, YAML, and TOML formats**.
   - Can reload past states to maintain context across sessions.
   
6. **Dynamic Learning & Adaptation**
   - Can **ingest documents** and **learn from external sources**.
   - Enables advanced analysis, such as **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

### **Example Workflow of TroveAgent**
- When an agent (e.g., Energy Assistant) is instantiated:
  1. It loads **configuration** and **memory states**.
  2. It **retrieves energy data** from `data_trove/energy_data.json`.
  3. It processes user requests through **LLM-based analysis**.
  4. It executes relevant **tools**, such as efficiency calculation.
  5. It **generates reports** and saves outputs for further use.

---
## Example: Running the Energy Assistant
The **Energy Assistant** is an agent that analyzes energy consumption and generates efficiency reports.

### **Step 1: Setup API Keys**
Ensure your `.env` file inside the `env/` folder has your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### **Step 2: Run the Energy Assistant**
Execute the script inside the `scripts_trove/` folder:
```sh
cd scripts_trove
python energy_assistant.py
```

### **Step 3: Expected Output**
- The script loads **energy data** from `data_trove/energy_data.json`
- It performs an **energy consumption analysis**
- It calculates **efficiency** using the efficiency tool
- Generates a **PDF report** with:
  - **Insights from AI** üìä
  - **Tabular Representation** üìù
  - **Graphs and Charts** üìà

### **Step 4: Locate the Report**
The PDF report is saved in the same folder as `energy_assistant.py`:
```
energy_report.pdf
```

# 2.Introduction to Mixture of Agents (MOA)**

The **Mixture of Agents (MOA)** architecture enhances Trove Agent's capabilities by distributing tasks across multiple agents, ensuring **scalability, depth, and efficiency**.

---

## **What is Mixture of Agents (MOA)?**
MOA is an advanced AI orchestration method where **multiple intelligent agents** work together to solve **complex problems**.

### **Why Use MOA?**
- **Improves Accuracy:** Each agent specializes in a specific task.
- **Enhances Scalability:** Workload is distributed across multiple agents.
- **Ensures Depth:** Each agent provides detailed insights.
- **Automates Decision Making:** AI agents handle specific tasks autonomously.

### **MOA in Action: Tesla Financial Analysis**
We use the **MOA approach** to conduct a **comprehensive financial analysis** of **Tesla (TSLA)** by distributing the task across three specialized agents:
1. **Financial Statement Analysis Agent**  
   - Examines Tesla‚Äôs **revenue, profit, and cash flow**.
   - Compares Tesla's performance with **Ford and GM**.
  
2. **Risk Assessment Specialist**  
   - Analyzes Tesla‚Äôs **financial stability, market risks, and regulatory risks**.
  
3. **Business Strategy Evaluator**  
   - Studies **Tesla‚Äôs expansion strategy, competitive positioning, and innovation**.

After **each agent completes its task**, the results are **aggregated into a structured report**.

---
